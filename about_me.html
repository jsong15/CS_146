      <h1>About John</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is John Song and I am 18 years old. I am Korean-American and I love traveling to Korea.  
        One activity that I like to do in my free time is complete logic puzzles and search up various kinds of riddles.
        Recently, I have been getting into playing tetris. Back when I was home, I enjoyed playing with my bass guitat, although I
        am not very good at it. My major is Computer Science.
